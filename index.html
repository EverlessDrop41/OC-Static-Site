            <p>Techo has a rainbow background because she is stubborn as f**k and won't choose a favourite colour</p>
            
            <p>That really descirbes Techo in a nutshell, stubborn and refuses to change. She is however warm harted and caring</p>
            
            <p>So far she doesn't have a significant other, she just kinds sleeps arounds</p>
            
            <p>Early on in her life she essentiall thought and saw the best in <strong>everyone</strong> and gave people multiple chances. Even though she has had to face the fact that some people are genuinely bad and won't change she naively makes the decision to see the best in people anyway. She does this even if it could end badly</p>
            
            <p>She tends to be quite motherly, this is likely due to her elder sister, eve, who is in a wheelchair. Having to look after eve and protecting her probably brought this motherly side to her personality</p>

           <p>Antonia puts on the show because she wants to be okay, but really she is not, she has lots of issues she is avoiding confronting</p>
           
           <p>She was assigned male at birth but now lives mostly female, however it can fluctuate a little. She is for the most part happy with her body</p>
